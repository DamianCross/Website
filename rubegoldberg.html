					<p>
						Design/build a Rube Goldberg device with a Start Task (pour a mixture of paperclips, golf tees, and marbles into the device), Bonus Task (sort this mixture) and a Final Task (light a light bulb) through a sequence of consecutive Energy Transfers, classified as electrical, mechanical, thermal, chemical, or electromagnetic. Parameters restrict the maximum dimensions and the use of hazardous materials. Bonus points are given for a smaller device. A maximum of 15 scoreable transfers are allowed.

						<p1>Design Overview</p1>
						<p>The frame of the device was created to be modular to allow easy access to all energy transfers and to optimize the use of walls to make the device as compact as possible.</p><br>

						<p>There are two halves to the device. The left half contains the bonus task, and the right half contains the majority of the transfers as well as a circuit box. Rather than have individual circuits dispersed throughout, all the circuits were hard-wired to lead to one area. Each circuit also has an individual switch, saving time during the 30-minute setup period. </p>

						<p1>Bonus Task</p1>
						<p>The containers were 3D printed out of thermoplastic powder and then coated in polyurethane to prevent them from dissolving in water.</p><br>
						<ol>
							<li>The mixture of paperclips, golf tees, and marbles is poured in the top container. </li>
							<li>Paperclips are then sorted out by neodymium magnets. </li>
							<li>The remaining marbles and golf tees roll into the water-filled second container. The less dense golf tees stay afloat near the top of the container while the denser marbles sink to the bottom of the second container. </li>
							<li>The marbles travel along the incline and then pass through a PVC connector into the final container. </li>

						<p1>Energy Transfer List</p1>
						<p>Each of the 5 basic energy forms can only be scored 3 times. 30, 20 and 10 points were awarded for the first, second, and third time each energy form was used, respectively. Points were also awarded for each golf tee, marble, and paperclip successfully sorted in their respective containers. </p><br>

						<p>I repeated some of the energy transfers without receiving any points to conveniently lead to transfers that had not already been used. During the national competition, our device performed as expected and we ultimately finished in 7th place.</p>
